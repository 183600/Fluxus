=== Advanced Python Decorator Patterns ===
=== Testing Class Decorators ===

--- Singleton Decorator ---
Database connection established: postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
db1 is db2: True
Connection string: postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb

--- Instance Counting Decorator ---
Person instances created: 3
Person 1: Person(name='Alice', age=25)
Person 2: Person(name='Bob', age=30)
Person 3: Person(name='Charlie', age=35)

=== Testing Parameterized Decorators ===

--- Retry Decorator ---
Attempting division: 10 / 2
Division result: 5.0
Attempting division: 10 / 0
Attempting division: 10 / 0
Attempting division: 10 / 0
Division failed after retries: Division by zero

--- Timeout Decorator ---
Starting slow operation for 1.0 seconds...
Slow operation result: Operation completed after 1.0 seconds
Starting slow operation for 3.0 seconds...
Operation timed out: Function slow_operation timed out after 2.0 seconds

--- Cache with TTL Decorator ---
Cache miss for expensive_calculation(<__main__.Calculator object at 0x7f521f1b2e40>, 5)
Performing expensive calculation for n=5
First call result: 30
Cache hit for expensive_calculation(<__main__.Calculator object at 0x7f521f1b2e40>, 5)
Second call result (cached): 30
Cache info: {'size': 1, 'keys': ['(<__main__.Calculator object at 0x7f521f1b2e40>, 5)[]']}
Waiting for cache to expire...
Cache miss for expensive_calculation(<__main__.Calculator object at 0x7f521f1b2e40>, 5)
Performing expensive calculation for n=5
Third call result (after cache expiry): 30

--- Rate Limiting Decorator ---
Making API call to: /api/endpoint0
API call 1: Response from /api/endpoint0
Making API call to: /api/endpoint1
API call 2: Response from /api/endpoint1
Making API call to: /api/endpoint2
API call 3: Response from /api/endpoint2
Rate limit exceeded: Rate limit exceeded. Wait 5.0 seconds.

=== Testing Advanced Decorator Patterns ===

--- Conditional Decorator ---
Skipping debug_function - condition not met
Debug mode is enabled - executing debug function

--- Composed Decorators ---
Complex operation result: Operation succeeded on attempt #3
