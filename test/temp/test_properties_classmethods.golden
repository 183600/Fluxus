=== Summary ===
Key concepts demonstrated:
1. Property decorators with getter, setter, and deleter
2. Calculated properties (read-only)
3. Properties with validation
4. Class methods for factory patterns and class-level operations
5. Static methods for utility functions
6. Inheritance with properties

Property vs Classmethod vs Staticmethod:
- Property: Instance-level computed attributes with optional validation
- Classmethod: Operations that affect the class itself or create instances
- Staticmethod: Utility functions that don't need instance or class state
