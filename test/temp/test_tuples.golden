=== Tuple Creation ===
Empty tuple: ()
Single tuple: (1,)
Pair tuple: (1, 2)
Multi tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Mixed tuple: (1, 'hello', 3.14, True)
Tuple without parens: (1, 2, 3, 4)

=== Tuple Indexing and Slicing ===
First element: 0
Last element: 9
Slice [2:5]: (2, 3, 4)
Slice [:3]: (0, 1, 2)
Slice [5:]: (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Slice [::2]: (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
Slice [::-1]: (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

=== Tuple Unpacking ===
x = 10, y = 20
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
After swap: a = 2, b = 1
Nested unpacking: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4

=== Tuple Operations ===
Concatenation: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Repetition: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
Length of tuple1: 3
2 in tuple1: True
10 in tuple1: False

=== Tuple Methods ===
Count of 2: 3
Index of 3: 2
Index of first 2: 1

=== Tuples as Dictionary Keys ===
Location at (0, 0): origin
Location at (1, 0): east

=== Nested Tuples ===
Matrix: ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
Element [1][2]: 6

=== Tuple Comparison ===
t1 == t2: True
t1 == t3: False
t1 < t3: True

=== Type Conversion ===
List to tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4)
Tuple to list: [1, 2, 3, 4]

=== All tuple tests completed ===
